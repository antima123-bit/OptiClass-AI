IDE's
If you are building / debugging in an IDE, you will need a postgres database. We recommend using docker:

docker run -it --rm -p 5432:5432 postgres:alpine
If you have another database you wish to connect to, set the ATHENA_CONNECTION_STRING environment variable.

You will need to install client-side packages and run the bundler manually. Client packages can be installed via npm:
cd src/OptiClass AI
npm install
To run the bundler in the background, run the bundle::watch script, which will repackage stylesheets and scripts when you save them in your IDE:

cd src/OptiClass AI
npm run bundle::watch
